Hi — I’m **Shamsuddin Ahmed**, a software developer with a focus on machine learning and backend systems.  
I've worked on a range of projects — from real-time vision pipelines on edge devices to tools for working with language models. Most of my work is around Python, modern ML frameworks, and building things that connect research to real-world use.

- **Recent work:** Helping build low-latency computer vision systems and generative AI tools at Indikat (remote).  
- **Past roles:** Contributed to legal-tech NLP tools at RootCode and developed backend services for analytics platforms at OMNAIBLE.  
- **Tools I use:** Python, PyTorch, LangGraph, Dify, YOLO, FastAPI, Docker, PostgreSQL, and more.

I enjoy experimenting with small side projects, sharing code, and learning new ideas in AI and software development. This site collects some of that work.
